Machine Learning - A Probabilistic Perspective
This book is suitable for upper-level undergraduate students and beginning graduate students in
computer science, statistics, electrical engineering, econometrics, or any one else who has the
appropriate mathematical background. Specifically, the reader is assumed to already be familiar
with basic multivariate calculus, probability, linear algebra, and computer programming. Prior
exposure to statistics is helpful but not necessary.

Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms
This book is aimed at senior undergraduates and graduate students in Engineering,
Science, Mathematics, and Computing. It expects familiarity with
calculus, probability theory, and linear algebra as taught in a first- or second year
undergraduate course on mathematics for scientists and engineers.

Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning
Focus on underlying concepts than on mathematical rigor
